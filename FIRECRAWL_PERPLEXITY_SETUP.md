```

### 2. Restart the Application

```bash
# Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild with new environment
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f app
```

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Quick Test

```bash
# Run the comprehensive integration test
python3 test_integrations.py
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ Service connectivity
- ‚úÖ API key validation  
- ‚úÖ Market research functionality
- ‚úÖ Vehicle scraping capabilities
- ‚úÖ Complete search workflow

### Manual API Testing

Test individual components:

```bash
# Check service status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/marketplace-status

# Test market research
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/market-research" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "make": "Toyota",
    "model": "Camry", 
    "year": 2018,
    "location": "FL"
  }'

# Test integration
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/test-integration"
```

## üöÄ New API Endpoints

### Search Execution

**Execute a search with Firecrawl scraping:**
```http
POST /api/v1/search-execution/execute
{
  "search_id": "your-search-id",
  "force_execution": true
}
```

**Get search results:**
```http
GET /api/v1/search-execution/search/{search_id}/results?limit=20
```

### Market Research

**Conduct AI-powered market research:**
```http
POST /api/v1/search-execution/market-research
{
  "make": "Toyota",
  "model": "Camry",
  "year": 2018,
  "location": "FL"
}
```

### Vehicle Analysis

**Analyze a specific vehicle:**
```http
POST /api/v1/search-execution/analyze-vehicle
{
  "vehicle_id": "vehicle-id-here",
  "include_market_research": true
}
```

### Service Status

**Check integration health:**
```http
GET /api/v1/search-execution/marketplace-status
```

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Search Execution Workflow

```
Create Search ‚Üí Execute Search ‚Üí Firecrawl Scrapes ‚Üí Perplexity Analyzes ‚Üí Opportunities Created
```

1. **Create Search Configuration**: Define criteria (make, model, price, location)
2. **Execute Search**: Triggers Firecrawl to scrape marketplaces
3. **Data Processing**: Normalizes and validates vehicle data
4. **AI Analysis**: Perplexity analyzes market conditions and pricing
5. **Opportunity Scoring**: Calculates profit potential and confidence
6. **Results Storage**: Saves opportunities to database

### 2. Market Analysis Features

- **Real-time pricing research** from multiple sources
- **Regional market insights** for FL/GA markets
- **Trend analysis** and market conditions
- **Competitive pricing** analysis
- **Profit calculations** with all costs included

### 3. Supported Marketplaces

- **AutoTrader**: Primary automotive marketplace
- **Cars.com**: Major vehicle listing site  
- **CarGurus**: Popular car shopping platform
- **Future**: Facebook Marketplace, local dealers

## üí∞ Cost Management

### API Usage Optimization

The system includes intelligent cost management:

- **Smart Caching**: 6-hour cache for market data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient scraping patterns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures to avoid wasted calls

### Estimated Monthly Costs

With moderate usage (5-10 searches/day):

- **Firecrawl**: $10-25/month
- **Perplexity**: $5-15/month  
- **Total**: ~$15-40/month

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key not present" errors:**
```bash
# Check your .env file has the keys
grep -E "(FIRECRAWL|PERPLEXITY)" .env

# Restart the application
docker-compose restart app
```

**"Service timeout" errors:**
```bash
# Check service logs
docker-compose logs app

# Verify connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
```

**"No vehicles found" results:**
```bash
# This is normal for new integrations
# Vehicles are only found when scraping marketplaces
# Try different search criteria or locations
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
# In .env file
DEBUG=true

# Restart
docker-compose restart app

# Watch detailed logs
docker-compose logs -f app
```

## üìà Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Market Research

```python
import httpx

async def research_toyota_camry():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/market-research",
            json={
                "make": "Toyota",
                "model": "Camry",
                "year": 2018,
                "location": "FL"
            }
        )
        data = response.json()
        print(f"Market trends: {data['market_trends']}")
        print(f"Price range: {data['average_pricing']}")
```

### 2. Execute Search and Get Results

```python
async def find_opportunities():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        # Execute search
        exec_response = await client.post(
            "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/execute",
            json={
                "search_id": "your-search-id",
                "force_execution": True
            }
        )
        
        # Get results
        results_response = await client.get(
            f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/search/your-search-id/results"
        )
        
        opportunities = results_response.json()
        for result in opportunities['results']:
            vehicle = result['vehicle']
            opp = result['opportunity']
            print(f"{vehicle['year']} {vehicle['make']} {vehicle['model']}: ${opp['projected_profit']:,.0f} profit")
```

### 3. Analyze Specific Vehicle

```python
async def analyze_vehicle(vehicle_id):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-execution/analyze-vehicle",
            json={"vehicle_id": vehicle_id}
        )
        
        analysis = response.json()
        print(f"Profit potential: ${analysis['profit_potential']:,.0f}")
        print(f"Confidence: {analysis['confidence_score']:.1%}")
        print(f"Recommendation: {analysis['recommended_action']}")
```
